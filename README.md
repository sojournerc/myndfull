This app uses gulp as a task runner, [rollup](http://rollupjs.org) as bundler, and [bublÃ©](https://buble.surge.sh/guide/) as transpiler.

Livereload will reload stylesheets if style changes occur and will reload the page if changes occur in client-side javascript. The [liveroload](http://livereload.com) extension needs to be installed on chrome for this to work.

Generator functions are supported in server-side code, but are not transformed for the client, so should not be used.

*Assumes node.js version > 4*
